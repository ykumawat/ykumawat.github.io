# Bootstrapping typewriter

We use `typewriter` for strongly-typed analytics in the `typewriter` CLI. While locally developing on Typewriter, feel free to test it on Typewriter itself (by running `yarn dev`).

If you end up in a bad state, where you can't run Typewriter to build this client because you don't have this client, then use the latest stable version of Typewriter: `npx typewriter`.
