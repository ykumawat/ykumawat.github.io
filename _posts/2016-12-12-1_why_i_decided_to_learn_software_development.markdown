For the past two years, before dinner and after the work day was done, my dad and I would sit down to brainstorm small e-commerce business ideas. We would bounce potentially interesting concepts off of each other, picking at various design flaws and researching market demands for the business we hoped to some day launch. Through this process, we came up with multiple viable, but just not so wholly satisfactory, ideas. In late summer of 2015, however, my dad and I decided upon and worked to create an e-commerce delivery service business targeted specifically for India. The business model is founded upon the growing rate of internet usage in India, mainly the city of Jaipur. It connects local businesses to a larger consumer base and helps facilitate everyday grocery and similar product shopping. 
My initial interest in the business rested largely in the creation of the business model. However, after learning HTML5, CSS, and Javascript coding basics through freecodecamp.com, I was able to further engage in the true creation of this company. From here, I wanted to have the ability to create applications such as this on my own - Flatiron's Fullstack Web Development program will allow me to do so!
